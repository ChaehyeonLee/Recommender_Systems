# Recommender Systems  

This repository is for study recommender systems.  
[ 추천시스템을 공부하기 위한 repository입니다. ]
  
I'm going to started with summarizing what I learned from 'Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI' course in LinkedIn, so I can refer to it later when I'm building my own recommender system.  
[ 추천시스템을 만들때 참고하기 위해 LinkedIn의 'Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI' 코스를 통해 공부한 내용 및 코드를 요약하면서 시작합니다. ]
